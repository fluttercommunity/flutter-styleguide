# flutter-styleguide
Flutter Style Guide. Suggested styles and best practices for teams using Flutter. 

# Flutter Team endorsed
Special thanks to (Matt Sullivan?, Tim Sneath?, Who else?) of the Flutter team, for reviewing and endorsing this style guide.

# Flutter Community written
It is written by the Flutter community, reflecting a concensus of best practices. We'd love for you to be part of that effort and to be listed as a [contributor](#contributors-flutter-rock-stars). [Here's how](#how-to-contribute)

# Overview
Developers have different styles of writing code. None are technically wrong but if we can all agree to write code using a particular style, that code ends up being easier for other developers to understand. Our hope is that this style guide will serve as a *starting point* for your team's style guide. We hope to suggest styles for all Flutter devs worldwide in order to create a kind of convention to make all Flutter code familiar and predictable to everyone else, knowing full well that your individual team will make adjustments where your preferences disagree with the Flutter community.

2. The committee will vote on how it should be worded and presented. A 2/3 majority of the committee is required for it to be modified.
3. Once decided, the author (or anyone else, really) will create a pull request with the changes as approved.
4. A member of the committee will merge the change.
5. Your changes are live and we will acknowledge your awesomeness! Fame, glory, and riches ensue.
