Flutter Style Guide. Suggested styles and best practices for teams using Flutter.

# Flutter Community written

The guide is written by the Flutter community, reflecting a consensus of best practices. We'd love for you to be part of that effort and to be listed as a [contributor](#contributors). [Here's how](#how-to-contribute)

# Overview

Developers have different styles of writing code. None are technically wrong but if we can all agree to write code using a particular style, it ends up being easier for other developers to understand. Our hope is that this style guide will serve as a *starting point* for your team's style guide. We hope to suggest styles for all Flutter devs worldwide in order to create a kind of convention to make all Flutter code familiar and predictable to everyone else, knowing full well that your individual team will make adjustments where your preferences disagree with the Flutter community.

# How to contribute

1. Open an issue on the issues page. We will leave that issue open for a reasonable request period so it can be discussed. All discussions should be in the github issue so the reasoning behind decisions are public and available to all.
2. The board will vote on how it should be worded and presented. A 2/3 majority of the board is required for it to be modified.
3. Once decided, the author (or anyone else, really) will create a pull request with the changes as approved.
4. A board member will merge the change.
5. Your changes are live and we will acknowledge your awesomeness. Fame, glory, and riches ensue.

# Organization
Standards are set by a team of developers chosen from the community. Your current board members are [Simon Lightfoot](https://github.com/slightfoot) and [Rap Payne](https://github.com/rapPayne). If you'd like to serve for a time, contact one of the current members.

The board does not currently have a quorum of three developers and will not set any styles until we get a third. 

# Rules
- The board will have between 3 and 9 members with one being the chair.
- A new member may be added by a 2/3 majority of the current members up to the maximum number of members.
- A current member may be removed by the same 2/3 majority vote.
- The chair is also set by a 2/3 majority. 
- The chair may change any style as long as he/she notifies the entire board. This is to prevent analysis paralysis. 
- Any change made by the chair can be reversed by a simple majority of the remaining board members.
- Any of the rules can be changed by a 2/3 majority vote of the current committee.

# Flutter Team endorsed

Once we get enough content, we'll ask for endorsement of the Google Flutter team.
